![speed reader demo](/speed-read.gif)

## Accelerate Your Reading

**Focus RSVP** is a productivity tool that utilizes **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation** to help you consume text at lightning speeds. By flashing words one by one at a fixed focal point, it eliminates the need for eye movements (saccades), allowing your brain to process information significantly faster.

### How to Use

1. **Insert Text**: Click the **Settings (⚙️)** icon in the top right. Paste the article, book chapter, or notes you want to read.
2. **Set Your Pace**: Use the slider to adjust the **Words Per Minute (WPM)**.
   - _Beginners_: 250 - 350 WPM
   - _Advanced_: 500 - 800 WPM
   - _Master_: 1000+ WPM
3. **The Red Target**: Always keep your gaze fixed on the **red character** in the center. Do not move your eyes; let the words come to you.

### Key Features

- **Optimal Focal Point (ORP)**: Dynamically highlights the center of each word to maximize cognitive processing.
- **Monospaced Precision**: Uses `JetBrains Mono` for consistent character width, preventing visual "jitter".
- **Focus Music**: Integrated ambient soundscapes to help maintain concentration.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar and word counter.
