## 🚀 Accelerate Your Reading
**Focus RSVP** is a productivity tool that utilizes **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation** to help you consume text at lightning speeds. By flashing words one by one at a fixed focal point, it eliminates the need for eye movements (saccades), allowing your brain to process information significantly faster.
